LegacyZenExercise
=================

An exercise built to test the AgileZen Legacy API. This project focuses on the commenting system found within the API to display up-to-date conversations.

Foreword
========

Before getting started with the project files, it is important to note that you must supply your own API key in order for the app to function correctly. You can paste your API_KEY in the AZRequest.m file.

Description
===========

ZenLegacy is a simple AgileZen client that displays the comments of a project as small conversations. Conversations can have one or more comments and are ordered by date. This allows you to quickly view a list of the most recent comments applied to your AgileZen projects. Selecting a comment in a conversation will display the entire list of comments related to that story.

Other functions include:

- deleting comments only generated by your username
- composing new comments
